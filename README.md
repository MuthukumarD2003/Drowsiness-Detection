Project Title: Drowsiness Detection System in Drivers using OpenCV. Description: A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night.
Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep.
Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy.
The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver.
 So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.
Problem it solves: Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.
The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds.
This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected. Requirements: The requirement for this Python project is a webcam through which we will capture images. You need to have Python (3.6 version recommended) installed on your system, then using pip, you can install the necessary packages.
1. OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (Face and eye detection).
2. Imutils – pip install imutils (To get landmarks of eye).
3. Scipy – pip install scipy (To calculate distance between eye landmarks).
4. Pygame – pip install pygame (To play alarm sound).5.      Dlib - pip install dlib
